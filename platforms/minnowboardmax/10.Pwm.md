# Pulse Width Modulation

## PWM, Drivers Enablement

Enable all PWM needed drivers via menuconfig and compile your Kernel

    user@Minnowboard:~$ cd linux
    user@Minnowboard:~$ make menuconfig

    @Linux Kernel Menuconfig > Device Drivers
    Symbol: PWM [=y]
    Prompt: Generic Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) support

    @Linux Kernel Menuconfig > Device Drivers > Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Support
    Symbol: PWM_LPSS [=m]
    Prompt: Intel LPSS PWM support

    @Linux Kernel Menuconfig > Device Drivers > Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Support
    Symbol: PWM_LPSS_PCI [=m]
    Prompt: Intel LPSS PWM PCI driver

    @Linux Kernel Menuconfig > Device Drivers > Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Support
    Symbol: PWM_LPSS_PLATFORM [=m]
    Prompt: Intel LPSS PWM platform driver
